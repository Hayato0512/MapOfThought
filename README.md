[comment]: <> (- Because personally I have been sick of those huge social media out there&#40;instagram, facebook, snapchat etc&#41; as their way of maximizing their profit is to make people hooked with their clever attention engineered service, and I think it has been really challenging problem for any generations especially younger generations. So I wanted to make a social media that merely serves them, intead of using them.)
